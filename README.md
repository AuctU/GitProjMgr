GitProjMgr is only a fork, right now exactly very much like GitButler, which is a git client that lets you work on multiple branches at the same time.

GitButler allows you to quickly organize file changes into separate branches while still having them applied to your working directory. You can then push branches individually to your remote, or directly create pull requests. 

In a nutshell, GitButler is a more flexible version of `git add -p` and `git rebase -i`, allowing your computer to efficiently multitask across branches. Having the **software multi-task** across branches, while the **devs are single-minded focused on the the differences**, instead of forcing the dev to multi-task in different windows or different machines is a HUGE DEAL! 

*The benefit is all in your MIND...*

### How Does GitButleer (GB) / GitProjMgr (GPM) Work?

GB/GPM keep track of uncommitted changes in a layer on top of Git. Changes to files or parts of files can be grouped into what we call virtual branches. Whenever you are happy with the contents of a virtual branch, you can push it to a remote. GB/GPM makes sure that the state of other virtual branches is kept separate.

### How Do These Virtual Branches in GB or GPM Differ From Git Branches?

The branches that we know and love in Git are separate universes, and switching between them is a full context switch. GB/GPM allows you to work with multiple branches in parallel in the same working directory. This effectively means having the content of multiple branches available at the same time.

GitButler is aware of changes before they are committed. This allows it to keep a record of which virtual branch each individual diff belongs to. Effectively, this means that you can separate out individual branches with their content at any time to push them to a remote or to unapply them from your working directory.

And finally, while in Git it is preferable that you create your desired branch ahead of time, using GitButler you can move changes between virtual branches at any point during development.

### Why GitButler? Why GitProjMgr

Managing source code and workflows are completely different, smarter, smoother and have leapfrogged ahead of the way things were done 25 years ago. It's a whole different work/social paradigm than than 50 year old Space Age concepts that were taught to managers in Engineering colleges and MBA programs and are still very much exactly the old single-guy-at-his-desktop appraoch driving the way a lot of work is still managed and done today.

GitButler is rethinking everything between when you write code in your editor of choice and when you push that code to GitHub for review. Why are you making 'wip' commits when your source code manager should be just recording everything for you? Why are everyone's commit messages pretty much useless? Why should something like git blame be the best way to get context on the code your team has written? Why can't you seamlessly transition work between computers? Why does "asynchronous collaboration" sound like an oxymoron to many people. 

The devs at GitButler recognized that Git's porcelain user interface hasn't been fundamentally changed for 15 years, but we still believe that the data model architecture is basically sound and *certainly not going away any time soon*. While Git was originally written for Linux kernel devs sending patches to each other over mailing lists, most developers today have different workflows and needs and most people engaged in other creative pursuits and project management chores certainly have *extremely* different and diverse workflows *ON THE SURFACE*. But underneath, it still goes back to the Git DVCS data model.

Instead of trying to fit the semantics of the Git command line interface into a graphical interface, the devs behind GitButler started with a more social, interactive, branched-coding developer workflow and mapped it back to the Git DVCS data model. 

The devs at GitButler created not only a new kind of Git client, but an entirely new way of thinking about managing the code that devs work on. A tool that helps you at every step of the software development process. A code concierge, hard at work for you to ensure that you'll never lose a moment of work again. That you'll have all the context and support you'll need around every line of code you work on.

### If the technology is so similar, why GitProjMgr

Our approach with GitProjMgr is really just to FORK GitButler ... and make a stab at taking this one step teesy further and to make project management workflows AI-assisted, in order to be primarily code-free and to instead allow for social branch coding to be done primarily with natural language prompts. GitButler / GitProjMgr are VERY similar applications, at least on the surface and for the most part, under the hood, too. So far, GitProjMgr is just a riff, just a fork.

We expect that GitProjMgr will have to make choices for even lower latency. The reason for that is to facilitate the incorporation of AI-assisted natural language features for social branch coding and development/publishing of visual knowledgegraphs of conceptual ideas in a data visualization approach inspired by [arXiv labs](https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html), [SemanticScholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Construction-of-the-Literature-Graph-in-Semantic-Ammar-Groeneveld/649def34f8be52c8b66281af98ae884c09aef38b) and [ConnectedPapers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/about).

## Bugs and Feature Requests

If you have a bug or feature request for GitButler, open an [issue](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/issues/new),
or [join the GitButler Discord server](https://discord.gg/MmFkmaJ42D).

## AI Commit Message Generation

Commit message generation is an opt-in feature. You can enable it while adding your repository for the first time or later in the project settings.

Currently, GitButler uses OpenAI's API for diff summarization, which means that if enabled, code diffs would be sent to OpenAI's servers.

Our goal is to make this feature more modular such that in the future you can modify the prompt as well as plug a different LLM endpoints (including local ones).

## Git Project Management Philosophy

While plans themselves are inexpensive to create and easily modified, their true value lies in the **iterative planning process**. No plan remains intact once implementation begins, but the planning exercise serves several critical functions in preventing the unnecessary wastage of capital, resouces, time, enthusiasm and good will. Exhaustive planning and preparation enables entrepreneurs to thoroughly visualize success and identify all necessary steps for achievement.

We begin with boilerplate frameworks that have worked. Then we develop artifacts for each of the five to seven major phases we identify for a venture launch. Those artifacts the phases of the project are ONLY a beginning -- we then begin to develop the artifacts for each of 100 points we identify as important for the new venture; as planning process proceeds, those 100 important points may changes as we see gaps or opportunities for consolidation. We bring in stakeholders, contractors, partners, investors, collaborators and we go over our plans with them ... then we revise and improve, revise and improve, revise and improve the plan ... we can plan a lot in a weekend, we can plan more in a week and almost too much in a month. But we intend to plan more in a month than many do in decades.

We are are ready to COMMIT, we launch MINIMAL viable protoypes and get customer reaction ... then we plan more and find ways to give the customers something better than what they want ... then we continue to launch, re-launch continually -- since our process involves designing in observability, we launch earlier and use our testing in production to refine our plan over and over and over.

This kind of intensity or speed involves less work/frustration than just cranking out things the way it used to be done. 1) People do not this kind of thing, unless they need to work like this. In fact, if you don't love doing this FOR FUN, you belong working for somebody else and getting a W-2 or 1099 as a contractor, 2) Work is what we did when were kids; now that we're old geezers, we *cheat* and we ***automate*** our cheating skill game; we don't use use AI, we make a game of becoming more savvy about AI in order to exlore every available intelligence gathering trick in the book.   

## Forward and Backward Planning Methodology

The most effective approach involves planning from both directions—forward from current position and backward from desired outcomes. At first, before committing to implementation, we begin with the end state and systematically work backward, identifying critical milestones required for success. In the end, it is the iterative polishing and planning, working the plan, sweating the details and assiduously revising and continually improving the plan that drives better execution. Nobody is going to care more than the project manager ... success does not just happen. It is programmed.

## Mental Preparation and Programming for Success
Strategic planning functions as intense mental programming for success. Before allocating capital, resources, or time, entrepreneurs must mentally simulate the entire business process. The enterpreneur must be able to see, hear, smell, taste and touch every step in the process long before it comes into fruition, even before and capital, resources, time, energy or effort is expended. While many venture concepts will not advance beyond the planning stage, the investigation process remains valuable—provided it occurs before significant resources are committed, nothing has been lost ... the time, effort, energy spent analyzing a plan will pay dividends in terms of tighter discipline and better execution down the line.

## Adaptation and Flexibility As a Matter of Discipline
Plans MUST inevitably evolve during implementation. The purpose of utilizing automated project management tools is to facilitate rapid, immediate, continuous refinement with minimal disruption. Once capital is deployed, most effort must focus on execution rather than planning. Starting a venture without adequate planning gaurantees resource misallocation and failure. Starting to manage project without adequate project management discipline and planning tools significantly increases the risk of unsuccessful, painful projects that even seasoned *project fixer magicians* will struggle to turn around.

In the final analysis, GitProjMgr is ONLY a tool -- the project management actually consists of doing the work. ***It's like a fitness app*** ... the fitness app does not do the important repititions for the person; the point of a fitness app is to spend less time searching for data such as finding new WODs and free the mind from tracking metrics ... in order to focus on doing quality repititions.
